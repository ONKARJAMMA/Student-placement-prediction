It is a Student Placement Prediction System that predicts whether a student is likely to get placed based on key factors like IQ, CGPA, 10th Marks, 12th Marks, and Communication Skills. This project is aimed at simplifying placement evaluation through technology.

ðŸŒŸ Project Overview:
Frontend: Developed using Flask for a clean and user-friendly interface.
Backend Deployment: Hosted on Render using Gunicorn for server management.
Machine Learning Model: Implemented Decision Tree Classifier for predictions.
Though the accuracy is currently low, the model works effectively, and this project has been a significant learning experience.
